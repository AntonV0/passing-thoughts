# Passing Thoughts
## Project #47 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This ReactJS web app is a place to store your passing thoughts. Your thought disappears 15 seconds after it's added, and it can also be deleted before the timer expires.
## What I Learned
  - Applying useState() hooks (instead of using classes)
  - Function components with syntax similar to stateless components
  - Using event.preventDefault() to stop the browser from refreshing the page
  - The setTimeout() method that executes its asynchronous function after a set time
  - Returning cleanup functions (to clear effects after they are no longer needed) to prevent unwanted behaviours such as memory leaks
